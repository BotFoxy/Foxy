## ðŸ’œ | Inviting Foxy to your server 
Use the public instance without hosting stuff, If you're here to see or use the code, why don't you try Foxy's public version? It's recommended using the public instance

## ðŸ’» | Self-hosting
If you want to self-host Foxy by yourself you can read the tutorial by [clicking here](https://github.com/FoxyTheBot/Foxy/blob/development/docs/SELF-HOSTING.md), We won't give support for people that are trying to self-host, so you should at least know how to troubleshoot issues, if you find.
